# Notes from Lesson 3: Things to remember

# del numbers[index] to delete an item in a list
# isinstance(item, type) to check if an item is an instance of something
# str.center(width) centers a string in a given width
# dict.update(other_dict) to update a dict with the key,values from other_dict and override if key exists
# my_list.copy() creates a shallow copy (which copies only the first layer, so uses pointers for everything possible)
# math.isnan() is the only way to check if something is NaN
# slicing of a list always returns a new list
